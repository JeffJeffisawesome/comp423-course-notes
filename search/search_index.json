Rust is a Low-level programming language, with built-in memory-safety, removing many of the headaches you would receive in <code>C/C++.</code> This tutorial aims to help you set up a docker container to run your Rust code in, and run your first piece of code in Rust! A more extensive tutorial can be found here, and documentation can be read here.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rust-setup/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<p>You must have docker installed and running before the dev container can be created.
